**Take care of your hair, it’s the crown that you never take off**

Luckily we’re here to help, Our team is going to develop a Healthcare & Beauty application that will help everyone maximize
their hair journey. 

Especially in Indonesia, where most people have problems with their hair routines due to the lack of inclusivity in the market. In a 
field dominated with straight euro centric hair care standards. It doesn’t seem fair to us. So our app goal is to help personalize 
products for everyones hair needs and promote diversity, whether it’s curly, oily, colored hair, we got you!
